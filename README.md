## Bengali Song Mood Predictor: A Machine Learning Endeavor

Discover the mood or emotion associated with Bengali songs through the innovative *Bengali Song Mood Predictor* project. Driven by a passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning, this endeavor aims to predict the mood of Bengali songs using cutting-edge technologies and a custom-made dataset.

### Project Overview

In collaboration with esteemed guidance from Prof. Sudipta Chakrabarty, a prominent faculty member of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (CSE-AIML) and Computer Science and Engineering - Data Science (CSE-DS) at Techno Main Salt Lake, our team embarked on an exciting journey to develop this mood prediction model.

### Key Components

- **Custom Dataset:** To ensure accuracy and relevance, we meticulously curated a custom dataset of Bengali songs, each meticulously labeled with specific emotions, including happiness, sadness, and more. This handcrafted dataset forms the backbone of our mood prediction model.

- **Python Libraries:** Leveraging the power of Python, we harnessed various libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pickle to construct and train the model. These industry-standard tools enabled us to unlock the full potential of our project.

- **Web App:** To provide a user-friendly experience, we created a local web app where users can explore the emotions of their favorite Bengali songs effortlessly. For seamless functionality, the system requires the scaler save file (`scaler.pkl`), the saved model file (`my_model`), and the dataset file (`dataset.csv`).
