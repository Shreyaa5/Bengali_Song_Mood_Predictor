# Bengali_Song_Mood_Predictor-
Bengali Song Mood Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the mood or emotion associated with Bengali songs. The project utilizes a custom dataset created for this purpose and employs various Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pickle to build and train the mood prediction model.
The dataset used for this project is a custom-made collection of Bengali songs labeled with their corresponding moods or emotions. The data has been curated by manually labeling each song with specific emotions like happy, sad, etc.
In order to run this web app locally, the system must have the scaler save file (scaler.pkl) and the saved model file (my_model). They should also download the dateset.csv file in order for the web app to work at its full potential.
